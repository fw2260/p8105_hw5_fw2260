## Problem 1

The homicide dataset contains information gathered by the *Washington
Post* on homicides in 50 major US cities. The dataset contains
information such as the victim’s name, age, race, sex, location, and
whether or not an arrest was made.

Reading and cleaning the homicide data:

``` r
homicide_df <-
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved")
    ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
view(homicide_df)
```

Get total unsolved homicides and total homicides for each city, then
perform prop test on Baltimore, MD:

``` r
aggregate_df <- homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
prop.test(aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
          aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Iterate through all the cities:

``` r
results_df <- aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Make a plot to display the proportion of unsolved homicides (+-
confidence interval) in all the cities:

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

## Problem 2

Read in all csv’s and tidying the result to include an `id` and `arm`
variable:

``` r
longitudinal_df <- 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("longitudinal_data")) %>% 
  mutate(path = str_c("longitudinal_data/", path),
         data = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  mutate(id = str_extract(path, "\\d+"),
         id = as.numeric(id),
         arm = str_extract(path, "con|exp")) %>% 
  relocate(id, arm, path,everything()) %>% 
  mutate(arm = recode(arm, con = "control", exp = "experimental")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8,
               names_to = "week",
               names_prefix = "week_",
               values_to = "value")
```
